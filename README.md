ruby-dnn is a ruby deep learning library. This library supports full connected neural network and convolution neural network
and recurrent neural network.
Currently, you can get 99% accuracy with MNIST and 82% with CIFAR 10.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ruby-dnn'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ruby-dnn

## Usage

### MNIST MLP example

```ruby
model = Sequential.new

model << InputLayer.new(784)

model << Dense.new(256)
model << ReLU.new

model << Dense.new(256)
model << ReLU.new

model << Dense.new(10)

model.setup(Adam.new, SoftmaxCrossEntropy.new)

model.train(x_train, y_train, 10, batch_size: 128, test: [x_test, y_test])

accuracy, loss = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
puts "accuracy: #{accuracy}"
puts "loss: #{loss}"
```

When create a model with 'define by run' style:  

```ruby
class MLP < Model
  def initialize
    super
    @d1 = Dense.new(256)
    @d2 = Dense.new(256)
    @d3 = Dense.new(10)
  end

  def forward(x)
    x = InputLayer.new(784).(x)
    x = @d1.(x)
    x = ReLU.(x)
    x = @d2.(x)
    x = ReLU.(x)
    x = @d3.(x)
    x
  end
end

model = MLP.new

model.setup(Adam.new, SoftmaxCrossEntropy.new)

model.train(x_train, y_train, 10, batch_size: 128, test: [x_test, y_test])

accuracy, loss = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
puts "accuracy: #{accuracy}"
puts "loss: #{loss}"
```

## Datasets
By setting the environment variable `RUBY_DNN_DOWNLOADS_PATH`, you can specify the path to read dataset.

* Iris  
* MNIST  
* Fashion-MNIST  
* CIFAR-10  
* CIFAR-100  
* STL-10

## Use GPU
If you do `require "cumo/narray"` before `require "dnn"`, you can run it on GPU.
Or, set the environment variable `RUBY_DNN_USE_CUMO` to `ENABLE` to force the GPU to be used.

## TODO
* Write a test.  
* Write a document.  
* Improve performance when using GPU.  

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake "test"` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
